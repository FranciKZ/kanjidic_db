# Kanjidic_DB

WIP project, please don't use :)

The end goal of this is to be able to easily create a SQL db structured around kanjidic2. There are a couple projects like this, but I wanted to try my hand at it to learn a little bit of Rust. I also will eventually use it for a side project.

Because of the above, the Rust is pretty poor I'm sure. If you come across this and are a Rust wizard please feel free to make a PR and offer advice.

For a project that seems to be fully working see: [edict_database](https://github.com/odrevet/edict_database)

My goals with the project are as follows:
* [x] Parse kanjidic xml file into structs
* [x] Create SQL script that will create all needed tables, structure TBD honestly
  * Going with a script instead of creating the DB and everything because I don't like migrating from DB to DB. I want a file that I can copy the contents of and then run against any DB I plan on using. I don't want to do like `SHOW CREATE TABLE` and copy that then run against my own db or anything.
* [ ] Maybe offer a way to give a connection string to have the script auto run?
* [x] Download latest kanjidic file for you and unzip it
* [ ] Provide command line arguments to pick and choose which properties you want to parse
  * Maybe command line arguments for different SQL syntaxes as well
* [ ] Maybe get working with JM Dict and generate a vocabulary table and such as well
* [ ] Learn Rust :)

Currently this will output a large creation script of all kanji with meanings, readings, and less than grade 8. Basically all the j≈çy≈ç kanji.

Honestly a little overkill for something that'll likely be used one time by anyone else who uses it, but ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Using

1. Clone the repo
2. Modify code if you want all kanji instead of just j≈çy≈ç
3. Run `cargo run`
4. Use `create_script.sql` to generate your db
